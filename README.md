> ### Why is this a thing?
> My University made 2FA mandatory (understandable) *BUT* they chose to work with DUO which means we have no choice but to use their proprietary app. For which the secret key isn't transferable ~~untill now~~
> meaning we weren't able to use 2FA apps that we've been using for a while...

> ### What will this allow you to do?
> - Get rid of DUO app/s
> - Use terminal to generate 2FA code.
> - Automate **THINGS**


### TO-DO

- [x] Make POC 
- [x] Create README.md 
- [ ] Create PiP package
- [ ] Create terminal app with argparse
- [ ] Add a better README.md
